# Chapter 5: Pretraining on Unlabeled Data

### Main Chapter Code

- [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) contains all the code as it appears in the chapter
- [previous_chapters.py](../../../src/llms_from_scratch/ch05/main_chapter_code/previous_chapters.py) is a Python module that contains the `MultiHeadAttention` module and `GPTModel` class from the previous chapters, which we import in [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) to pretrain the GPT model
- [gpt_download.py](../../../src/llms_from_scratch/ch05/main_chapter_code/gpt_download.py) contains the utility functions for downloading the pretrained GPT model weights

### Optional Code

- [gpt_train.py](../../../src/llms_from_scratch/ch05/main_chapter_code/gpt_train.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) to train the GPT model (you can think of it as a code file summarizing this chapter)
- [gpt_generate.py](../../../src/llms_from_scratch/ch05/main_chapter_code/gpt_generate.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) to load and use the pretrained model weights from OpenAI
